Example of a Scala client for [message-db](https://github.com/message-db/message-db), built on [Skunk](https://tpolecat.github.io/skunk/).

```
docker compose up -d
sbt clean test
```

This is currently an example/prototype that does very little. Maybe this could become a real open source project someday.
